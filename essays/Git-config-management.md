## Thoughts on Configuration Management

I've had some prior experience with Git, and I find that Git and configuration management as a whole are great for large scale projects. As students, we don't really work on projects that contain more than 1000 lines of code. However, in the real world, programs consist of hundreds of thousands of lines of code. All of this code is hard to keep track of and the changes made could break the program. Configuration management alleviates this issue by saving changes and keeping track of where the changes are and who made them. This saves a surprising amount of headache when debugging and can solve many problems in just a few moments.
