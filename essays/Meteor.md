## Where am I?

After spending about 7 weeks learning about JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Semantic UI, I thought learning Meteor was going to be a smooth ride. I was terribly mistaken. The ride so far seems more like launching into space at what seems like the speed of light. Lots of concepts are flying past me and I have no idea what's going on. Thankfully, the rocket is running out of fuel and things are slowing down. I'm finally getting an understanding of how Meteor works. 

## Where Did This Mess Come From?

You'd think that, being in space, there would be very few obstacles to overcome. I was wrong yet again. In the learning process, I used template code to model applications after. There's one big caveat to it: CONSISTENCY. While coding, changes need to be made to reflect the meaning of objects and variables. However, if you happen to leave a name unchanged somewhere, Meteor WILL call you on it. The code needs to be 100% consistent with correct syntax in order to satisfy Meteor. 

## There's Light at the End of This Tunnel... Right?

I got launched so fast and travelled so far, I've entered a wormhole. From the planet Earth, I took my survival skills of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Semantic UI. Now, I travel toward the unknown... One thing is certain: I'll be able to face whatever challenges await since I have the foundations of good web development. 

## Final Thoughts

Although Semantic UI is the only UI framework I've used thus far, I can confidently say that it's completely worth the time investment. Even the initial frustration that came with using Semantic UI is now turning into overwhelming appreciation for UI frameworks. As a matter of fact, before learning about UI frameworks, I had no idea they existed. I thought I would be using raw HTML and CSS for the rest of my life as a software developer. Thankfully, I was introduced to Semantic UI. I'm definitely reminiscent of the time I was first introduced to IDEs. In a smiliar fashion, I'm appreciative of the fact I was told about UI frameworks and learned about Semantic UI. My life with HTML and CSS will never be the same. It only gets better from here.
